in the TPart_id_old.cc there is the working version of the code for
acceptance in multivariables
In the TPart_id_old2.cc now there is the version with only Q2 acceptance
calculation, where a more refine bin was used (only 1 variable)
TPart_id_old3.cc is the one with delta E cut,
TPart_id.cc I have added the TTree for storing the acceptance variables +
 the mass of the rho.
