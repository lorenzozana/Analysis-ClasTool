Load Tools_fidc.C (command: .L Tools_fidc.C++)
Load fidc_cut.cc  (command: .L fidc_cut.cc++)
as in the example, the program should have the lines:


#include "fidc_cut.h"


The fiducial parameters for a certain beam energy are Loaded in the code with:


TFidCut test("param40.txt");  // In this case for 4.0GeV 


The fiducial cut function need a TVector3 of the momentum as input:

V3p = (evnt->GetMomVec());


The fiducial cut is passed if the function CheckCut( ) return 1, for example (in this case 
test was defined before:

test.CheckCut(V3p)==1
